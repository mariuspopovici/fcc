/**
 * Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Smallest Common Multiple.
 *
 * Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that can be evenly divided by both,
 * as well as by all sequential numbers in the range between these parameters.
 * The range will be an array of two numbers that will not necessarily be in numerical order.
 * For example, if given 1 and 3, find the smallest common multiple of both 1 and 3 that is also evenly divisible
 * by all numbers between 1 and 3. The answer here would be 6.
